This is a fork of [Light Host ](https://github.com/rolandoislas/LightHost) by [Rolando Islas](https://github.com/rolandoislas), a cross-platform, lightweight VST/AU hosting software. The original repo hasn't been updated since late 2016, and the original author, Islas, hasn't been active on GitHub since late 2019. I've been using the macOS version of this software for a while now, and its low quality menubar icon kinda bugged me, so I figured I'd update all the icons to the latest macOS spec, and (hopefully) update it to work with the everchanging macOS permissions and security system, making sure it doesn't break in the future.

There're a few things I want to impliment:

1. UI dark mode
2. Upscaled menubar icon. Currently the icon is really low res and only the white version is available.
3. The app has an issue where when clicking the menubar item, the app would pop up in the dock, idk what's causing this, but i want to fix it
4. A switch to turn the mic on/off, i like to have softwares running in the background all the time, Light Host itself doesn't use much resources but it keep the mic indicator on and the plugins do take up some resources, so having a switch would be more convenient
